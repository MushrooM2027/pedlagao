        <h1>The Ruin</h1>
        <h3>"We took more than we gave."</h3>

        <p>As time passed, things began to change. People wanted more—more land, more food, more things. Forests were cut down to build cities. Rivers were blocked to make dams. Mountains were dug up to find metals and stones. What once was green and full of life became dry and empty.</p>

        <p>Factories started appearing. They made goods quickly but filled the air with smoke. Dirty water from these factories flowed into rivers, killing fish and plants. Cars filled the roads, releasing gases that made the air hard to breathe. Garbage piled up in places where children once played.</p>

        <p>Plastic became common. It was used for bottles, bags, and packages. But most of it wasn’t reused or recycled. It ended up in the oceans, harming turtles, dolphins, and fish. Birds mistook it for food and died. Coral reefs, once colorful and lively, turned white and lifeless.</p>

        <p>Climate started changing. The Earth grew hotter. Ice at the poles began to melt. Sea levels rose, flooding homes and farms. Some animals lost their homes forever. Bears couldn't find ice to hunt, birds flew to the wrong places, and plants bloomed too early or too late.</p>

        <p>Fires became more common. Forests that had lasted centuries burned in days. Animals couldn’t escape. Trees turned to ash. Smoke darkened the sky, making it hard for people to breathe. These weren’t just natural fires—they were worsened by how we treated the Earth.</p>

        <p>Many warnings were given. Scientists, activists, and even children spoke out. They showed us facts, told stories, and begged us to act. But too often, their voices were ignored. We continued to live in a way that hurt the planet. Every new road, every factory, every cut-down tree added to the damage.</p>

        <p>People became disconnected from nature. Children grew up with screens, not trees. They knew more about cartoons than butterflies. The songs of birds were drowned by traffic. Rivers once filled with fish now carried plastic bottles and foam cups.</p>

        <p>This was the ruin. Not because one person made a mistake, but because many did, every day, without thinking. The ruin was slow but certain. It turned paradise into problem. Beauty into burden.</p>

        <p>But even in this ruin, a question remained: Is it too late? Can we still change? Can we learn from our mistakes?</p>
