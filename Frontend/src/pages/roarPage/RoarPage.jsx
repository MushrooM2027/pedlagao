        <h1>The Roar</h1>
        <h3>"A movement begins. Led by you."</h3>

        <p>Then came the roar. It wasn’t the sound of animals or machines. It was the voice of people—rising, shouting, singing, and demanding change. It was the sound of awareness and action. It came from children, students, teachers, farmers, and dreamers. It came from you.</p>

        <p>People began to notice what was happening. They realized that if they didn’t act, the planet would suffer beyond repair. So they stood up. They marched. They wrote letters, shared messages, planted trees, and made choices that helped instead of harmed.</p>

        <p>Schools started teaching about the environment. Kids learned to reuse, reduce, and recycle. Families started growing plants at home. Cities built parks and bike paths. Lights were turned off when not needed. Rainwater was collected. Old clothes were donated instead of thrown away.</p>

        <p>Technology helped too. Solar panels provided clean energy. Electric cars reduced pollution. Scientists found new ways to clean water and grow food. Farmers switched to natural methods. Big companies promised to stop using plastic and cut down pollution.</p>

        <p>Social media played a big part. One video of a turtle stuck in plastic moved millions. Photos of wildfires and melting glaciers made people cry and act. Young activists like Greta Thunberg showed that age didn’t matter—only courage and care did.</p>

        <p>Tree-planting drives filled cities with green again. Beaches were cleaned by volunteers. People started carrying cloth bags, steel bottles, and saying no to plastic. Communities came together for Earth Hours and clean-up days.</p>

        <p>The roar was loud and growing. It said, “We care.” It said, “We are ready to change.” And most importantly, it said, “It’s not too late.”</p>

        <p>Yes, damage has been done. But nature is strong. Trees grow back. Rivers can be cleaned. Air can become fresh again. Animals can return. All they need is time and help.</p>

        <p>The roar is hope. It’s the fire in the heart of every person who loves this planet. And now, that includes you.</p>

        <p>This is not just a story. It’s a call. You can be part of the solution. Plant a tree. Save water. Ride a bicycle. Speak up. Every small act matters.</p>

        <p>The Earth is listening. And it’s ready to heal—with your help. So let your voice join the roar. Because the future is green, and it starts now.</p>
